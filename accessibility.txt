In web development, accessibility is the practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible. It involves designing and developing websites so that people with disabilities can use them. 

Accessibility benefits people with impairments, as well as people who use different devices, browsers, or network conditions. It also improves a web app's SEO, performance, and user satisfaction. 

Accessibility settings can help users who have visual, auditory, cognitive, motor, or other impairments. They can also benefit users with temporary or situational difficulties, such as using a device in bright sunlight or with one hand. 

Accessibility is built upon four foundational principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust. 
These principles ensure that web content is accessible and usable for all, including those with disabilities.
